This project is a web-based tool designed to assist in password recovery for protected files (such as ZIP, PDF, etc.) and generate password combinations based on user-provided hints. It supports two main functionalities:

1. File Password Cracker



Common Password Attack: Uses a predefined list of 100 to 100,000 common passwords to attempt file decryption.

Hint-Based Password Generation: Allows users to enter optional hints (e.g., targetâ€™s name, birth year, keywords), which the system uses to generate and test over 3,000+ possible password combinations.

Optional Brute Force Attack: Includes a limited brute force mode that systematically tries different character combinations (with configurable length and character sets).
