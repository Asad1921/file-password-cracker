# Hint-base-Password-Generator
This is hint based Password Generator .IN this Graphical user interface a web base GUI is included in which user can enter multiple hints separated with commas and then a list of thousands of passwords generated user can read these also download this list as a .txt file.
This project is a web-based tool designed to assist in password recovery for protected files (such as ZIP, PDF, etc.) and generate password combinations based on user-provided hints. It supports two main functionalities:

1. File Password Cracker



Common Password Attack: Uses a predefined list of 100 to 100,000 common passwords to attempt file decryption.

Hint-Based Password Generation: Allows users to enter optional hints (e.g., targetâ€™s name, birth year, keywords), which the system uses to generate and test over 3,000+ possible password combinations.

Optional Brute Force Attack: Includes a limited brute force mode that systematically tries different character combinations (with configurable length and character sets).


2. Password Generator



Hint-Based Password Generation: Users can input hints (e.g., personal details, common patterns), and the tool generates up to 100,000 possible password combinations.

Export Functionality: Allows users to view the generated passwords and download them as a .txt file for use in other password-cracking tools like Hashcat, John the Ripper, or similar.
